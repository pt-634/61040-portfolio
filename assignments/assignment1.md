#### 3 to expand on

- **Music**. I love listening to music. I listen to a lot of albums all the way through, but occasionally I like making playlists. But it's difficult for me to figure out how to make a playlist from the songs I like that fit different scenarios, especially without having to leaf through all 1-2k songs I've ever liked on Spotify. Furthermore, I listen to music on several different apps, and I'd like to be able to listen to songs on all these platforms at once. Some situations where I listen to music are while doing work, while exercising, while walking / commutting places, while with friends (both in person or virtually, like through Discord music bots for example), and while in the car.
- **Greek Life**. I'm the president of my fraternity, Nu Delta. I've learned a lot while living in the house and learning about taking care of it. However, I noticed that there's an issue of documentation, and in multiple ways: the activation energy required to get people to document things seems to be too high, and the ability to look in the right place for certain information (especially the more specific it gets) is really difficult. I want to pass on as much knowledge as possible, but also make it easier for future presidents (or the average member) to learn the things I struggled to scrape together.
- **Cards**. I try to always keep at least two decks of standard playing cards with me. I know a decent amount of card games, and I'm trying to learn how to do tricks and shuffle better, as well as improve my skills in certain games like Poker and Spades.

## Problems

#### Music
- all the music bots my friends and I used to use on Discord stopped working
- i would like to shuffle music or create a playlist across all the music apps i use (primarily soundcloud and spotify)
- i listen to music super slowly, itd be nice to have a widget or something that keeps track of music i need to listen to and makes a suggestion for an album ive yet to give a first listen
#### Greek Life
- finances are a little hard to track, especially when it comes to housing bills payments, fines, and refunds for frat-related purchases
- our documentation/knowledge-base is not that easy to parse through to find useful information
- we do not have a good management system for keeping inventory of rooms in the house, and often buy more things when we already have them
#### Cards
- i always forget card games and it would be nice to have a way to recall what games are good to play, especially depending on the number of decks i have and the number of people are playing and depending on how easy the games are to learn. would nice to have a streamlined explanation process for all the games too
- it would be nice to have an online cards playing template, to which i could port card games. this would be nice in situations where i forget to bring my decks of cards and would like to play something that isnt crazy8 on imessage
- it would be nice to streamline the process of creating new card games

#### Selections + Explanations
- **Discord Music Bot**.
	- Entails coding a Discord bot. Picked because the goal is clear, the scope seems feasible, is a dynamic thing, and has immediate personal use cases (I've been talking to my friends about creating one for years now.)
- **Fraternity Finances**
	- Picked because it is a pain point within our fraternity. Can be scoped reasonably then expanded upon later probably but I'm not sure. This also just seems like something I'd enjoy making and be able to get lots of feedback on.
- **Card Game Recommender**
	- Feels decently scoped, helps solve a problem I come across frequently. Has potential to be used by others.
#### Unselected Ideas
- Music
	- cross platform playlist shuffler involves making separate existing music apps work together with one another, and is harder to test the fewer apps I have access to (would be limited to Spotify + Soundcloud)
	- music listening recommender feels solvable by many existing things, or like even just the notes app or something
- Greek Life
	- documentation center probably isnt worth the effort. documentation is already put together in google drive, it would probably look like something adjacent to recreating an existing app like notion or something, and i dont think it would be super interesting nor get used as intended
	- room inventory tracker might be a little too simple or solvable with existing apps
- Cards
	- https://playingcards.io/ seems to already accomplish one version of the online cards template idea (rules enforced by players), and the version that allows users to create rulesets seems very difficult to do while keeping things generalized enough for any game to be added
	- a card game creator doesn't seem very interesting now that I think about it. it also isn't something most people interested in cards would care for I feel.

## Stakeholders

- **Discord Music Bot**.
	- **Listener**
		- they add music to the bot's song queue and listen to it while in a discord call
		- *impact*: cannot share music in calls without a reliable bot. trying to use third-party tools to accomplish this goal can become a headache that leads to nowhere
	- **Music Platform**
		- the place the bot acquires the music from (spotify, soundcloud, youtube, etc.)
		- *impact*: might view bots as misuse of their APIs (which may have caused the takedowns for all the previous bots)
	- **Discord**
		- platform hosting the bot
		- *impact*: this is party concerned with moderation stuff and potential copyright violations and stuff
- **Fraternity Finances**
	- **Treasurer**
		- manages dues, fines, and reimbursements
		- *impact*: treasurer can become overwhelmed with managing all these things. this would help remove the potential for their human error and decrease stress. would also help with documentation of communication for late payment fees and other things
	- **Members**
		- pays dues, pays fines, submits reimbursement requests
		- *impact*: helps them maintain a clear understanding of their financial obligations and improve their ability to pay house bills
	- **Alumni**
		- may or may not use app directly but oversee overall financial situation of the house
		- *impact*: they care about the financial health of the fraternity, and would be interested in anything that removes any friction for housebills being paid and improves our accounting methods
- **Card Game Recommender**
	- **New Players**
		- people hoping to get into new card games
		- *impact*: can help with their ability to learn how to participate in new card games and improve card game experiences
	- **Old Players**
		- people hoping to help other people learn how to play new card games
		- *impact*: can simplify the process of teaching new players how to play and make coming up with games to play simpler
	- **Card Game Publishers**
		- people who create games with standard playing cards
		- *impact*: can help with discovery of card games, but also risk having games being misrepresented or played wrong if summarized poorly
